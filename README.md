This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python functions that can lead to unexpected behavior. The `function_with_uncommon_error` function handles exceptions (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError), but it returns `None` in case of an error which can lead to runtime issues if not handled gracefully by the calling function.  The solution shows how to improve the function to either raise the exception or return a more informative value, preventing such silent failures. This is useful to understand edge cases in exception handling and how to avoid them for robust Python code.
